On My Way

I want to kill this man
But he turned around and ran
I'll kill him with karate
That I learned in Japan
He wouldn't see my face
I wouldn't leave a trace
I wouldn't use a bullet
'Cause a bullet's a disgrace

Aw, momma
I never thought that I was a murdering man
But tonight I'm on my way
Tonight I'm on my way

There's this drawer that I know
In a house up the road
That's full of things
That are easily sold
When they go out of town
I could go and snoop around
And make myself rich
Off the things that I found

Aw, momma
I never thought that I was a stealing man
But tonight I'm on my way
Tonight I'm on my way

I was sitting on the bleacher
Staring at the speaker
Reading his lips
But I could not understand
So I opened up my ears
And clearly I could hear
This detailed story
All about a grain of sand

Aw, momma
I always dreamt of being a good listener
So tonight I'm on my way
Tonight I'm on my way

There's this kid you gotta meet
He lives across the street
He's got spirit and heart
We're ten years apart
He is up for anything
He can hang with anyone
He still likes the things
We used to think were fun

Aw, momma
I never thought that I could have a friend
But tonight I'm on my way
Tonight I'm on my way

I'm in love with someone
Who's as pretty as a flower
Her life gives me power
So I'm buyin' her a ring
She makes hats with her hands
She is such an artist
I'm her biggest fan
And I'm teaching her to sing

Aw, momma
I never thought that I could love no one
But tonight I'm on my way
Tonight I'm on my way
